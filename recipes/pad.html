    <h2>What Is Thai Basil Chicken</h2>
    <p> Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Shallots and garlic</li>
        <li>Hot chile peppers</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>To get started, you'll add the oil and minced chicken to a smoking-hot skillet and cook the chicken briefly for a couple of minutes. </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Next, you'll add the shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies, and cook for another couple of minutes. About a tablespoon of the sauce goes in next to cook for a minute with the chicken until it starts to caramelize on the skillet. Finally, you add the rest of the sauce, scraping up the caramelization and coating the chicken for another minute</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil until it's wilted from the residual heat. Now your Thai Basil Chicken is ready to serve.</p>
